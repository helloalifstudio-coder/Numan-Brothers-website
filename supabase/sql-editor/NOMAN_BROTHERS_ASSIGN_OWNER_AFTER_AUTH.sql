-- NOMAN BROTHERS - ONE VERIFIED OWNER ACCOUNT (RUN AFTER FRESH CMS INSTALL)
-- =============================================================================
-- Step 1: Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > Users > Add user.
--         Create the client's actual Gmail and a strong password *there*;
--         verify/confirm the email with the owner.
-- Step 2: The starter owner_email below is admin@gmail.com. Only proceed if
--         THAT EXACT email belongs to the verified, confirmed intended owner.
--         Change it to the actual owner address before a real client launch.
-- Step 3: Run this file in the SQL Editor of the SAME project as Vercel.
-- Step 4: Sign out of /studio and sign back in to refresh JWT role claims.
--
-- NEVER put a plaintext password, service_role key or client Gmail password
-- into this script, GitHub, Vercel VITE_* variables, or frontend source code.
-- This script does not create Auth users; Auth must create credentials safely.
-- It does not set passwords. Choose a strong, unique password in Auth Users.
-- After signing into Studio, the owner can change email and password securely
-- in Account & security. Neither change grants new roles.
-- It refuses to override any different existing privileged staff account.
